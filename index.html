 Since the beginning of 2021, more than half a million people have been forced to flee their homes in Afghanistan to escape increasing conflict, and the number continues to rise. <br><br>

The United Nations has warned that up to half a million Afghans could flee the country by the end of the year and has called on neighbouring countries to keep their borders open. 
The current crisis comes on top of the 2.2 million Afghan refugees already in neighbouring countries and 3.5 million people forced to flee their homes within Afghanistan's borders. <br><br>
